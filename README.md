## Usage

To start, click on the generate password button to see a browser window pop-up. This prompt will accept numerical digits between 8 and 128. If the user enters anything outside of these parameters, then a window will pop-up indicating that the user should try again. After the initial question, the user should then click "OK" to include the following options: numbers, lowercase letters, uppercase letters and special characters. Upon clicking the final window pop-up, a newly random password will be displayed on the screen based off of the user's inputs. 

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
